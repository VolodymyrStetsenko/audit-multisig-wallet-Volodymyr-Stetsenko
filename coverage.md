# 🧮 Test Coverage Summary

## Functions Covered
- [x] `executeERC20Transfer`
- [x] `confirmTransaction`
- [x] `isConfirmed`
- [x] `isOwner`
- [x] `addTransaction`
- [x] `getTransactionCount`

## Critical Paths Tested
- ✔️ Normal flow: add → confirm → execute
- ✔️ Revert: double confirm, not owner, already executed
- ❗ Not covered: reentrancy defense (tested via Slither)

## Suggested Improvements
- Mock ERC20 interaction for runtime validation
- Test with variable confirmation thresholds
