| executeTransaction   | internal   | ✅ Yes (indirect) | ✅ Yes               |
| executeERC20Transfer | external   | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes               |
| isConfirmed          | public     | ✅ Yes (indirect) | N/A                 |
| isOwner              | internal   | ✅ Yes (indirect) | ✅ Yes               |
| addTransaction       | internal   | ✅ Yes (indirect) | ✅ Yes               |
| receive()            | external   | ❌ Not Tested     | N/A                 |

> 🔍 Note: `addTransaction`, `isOwner`, and `isConfirmed` are indirectly tested via the `executeERC20Transfer` and `confirmTransaction` logic.

## 🧠 Slither-Detected Risks and Coverage

| Slither Finding ID | Description                                   | Covered in Tests? | Static Analysis Notes                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SL-01A             | Reentrancy: state updated after external call | ✅ Indirect        | Covered in Slither, test reentrancy missing |
| SL-01B             | Event after external call                     | ❌ Not Tested      | Only in Slither                             |

## 🚫 Limitations & Gaps

| Area                       | Status    | Reason                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reentrancy Simulation      | ❌ Skipped | Not simulated with reentrancy mocks                        |
| ERC20 Mock Testing         | ❌ Missing | Actual ERC20 interaction not validated via mocks           |
| Overflow/Underflow Testing | ❌ Missing | Solidity ^0.8.x has built-in checks, not explicitly tested |
| Receive Function Test      | ❌ Missing | No direct test for ETH deposits via fallback/receive       |
| Token Contract Validations | ❌ Missing | No checks for ERC20 compliance or address.code.length used |
| Gas Limit DoS Resistance   | ❌ Missing | No explicit testing for gas starvation or overuse          |

## 🧪 Test Configuration

| Property                | Value    |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Number of Owners        | 3        |
| Required Confirmations  | 2        |
| ETH Balance in Tests    | 10 ether |
| ERC20 Recipient Address | 0x999    |
| Token Mock Used         | ❌ No     |
| Test Framework          | Forge    |

## 🛠️ Suggested Improvements

* ✅ Add **ERC20 mock contract** to simulate `transfer()` success/failure.
* ✅ Test `receive()` fallback by sending ETH to contract directly.
* ⚠️ Include **more scenarios**: invalid transaction ID, confirm after execution, etc.
* ✅ Improve test naming for clarity: e.g., `testConfirmFailsIfNotOwner()`
* ✅ Consider dynamic threshold tests (e.g., `required = 1`, `required = 3`)

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

Current test coverage demonstrates solid verification of all **primary logical paths**, including:

* Transaction creation
* Confirmation logic
* Execution flow
* Error conditions and revert paths

However, **edge-case and runtime validation coverage remains limited**, particularly for ERC20 execution and malicious reentrancy.

🟡 Overall Coverage Rating: **Medium–High**

✅ Ready for production **with additional unit & fuzz tests prior to mainnet deployment**.
