## 🚫 Known Gaps in Coverage

| Area                          | Status      | Explanation |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| ERC20 Mock Token              | ❌ Missing  | No mock contract to verify ERC20 success |
| Reentrancy Simulation         | ❌ Skipped  | Requires test attack contract |
| ETH receive() functionality   | ❌ Not tested | Not directly tested |
| Token address validation      | ❌ Missing  | Should check `code.length > 0` |
| Gas-exhaustion scenarios      | ❌ Not tested | No DoS/resistance tests |
| Overflow/Underflow Logic      | ⚠️ Partial | Relying on ^0.8.x safety |

---

## 🧭 Recommendations

- Add mock ERC20 token contract for `transfer()` behavior validation.
- Create test cases to simulate:
  - calling `receive()` function
  - malformed confirmation calls
  - reentrancy logic (simulated attack)
- Move toward 100% coverage for production readiness.
