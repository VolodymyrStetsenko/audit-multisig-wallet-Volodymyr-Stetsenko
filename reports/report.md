# 🔐 Smart Contract Security Audit Report

**Project:** Multi-Signature Wallet  
**Author:** Volodymyr Stetsenko  
**Audit Performed By:** Volodymyr Stetsenko (manual audit)  
**Audit Date:** May 2025  
**Contract Filename:** `MultiSig.sol`  
**License:** MIT  
**Status:** ✅ Initial audit complete

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

This audit evaluates the security of a custom-built Multi-Signature Wallet smart contract written in Solidity. The wallet allows multiple owners to collectively approve transactions using a predefined number of confirmations. The final version includes ERC20 token support and core execution logic.

---

## 🧪 Audit Scope

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ Code Review | Full manual review of business logic and data flow |
| ✅ ERC20 Integration | Functionality using encoded calldata |
| ✅ State Validation | Verification of confirmation and execution status |
| ❌ Unit Tests | Not included yet (to be added later) |

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Manual line-by-line code review
2. Logical attack simulations (reentrancy, call injection)
3. Risk classification based on impact and exploitability
4. Recommendations for remediation

## 🚨 Findings Summary

| ID | Title                         | Severity | Status     |
|----|-------------------------------|----------|------------|
| 1  | No protection against replay  | Medium   | Reported   |
| 2  | Unsafe use of `call()`        | Medium   | Reported   |
| 3  | No expiry or timeout on txs   | Low      | Reported   |
| 4  | ERC20 call lacks return check | Medium   | Reported   |
| 5  | Owners stored in array only   | Low      | Reported   |

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 1. ❗ No Replay Protection

**Description:**  
Transactions can be repeated if the same parameters are reused. There is no `nonce` or unique identifier for each transaction payload.

**Recommendation:**  
Add `uint256 nonce` to transaction struct and increment it upon creation.

---

### 2. ⚠️ Unsafe use of `.call()`

**Description:**  
Execution via `call{value: txn.value}(txn.data)` can be exploited for reentrancy or unexpected behavior if the target is malicious.

**Recommendation:**  
Set `txn.executed = true` **before** the `call` line to prevent reentrancy.

---

### 3. ⏳ No Expiry / Timeout

**Description:**  
Old transactions remain valid forever and may be executed unexpectedly.

**Recommendation:**  
Add a `createdAt` timestamp and a `timeout` parameter to transactions.

---

### 4. 💸 ERC20 `transfer()` Not Checked

**Description:**  
ERC20 token transfers via `call()` don't check for returned `true` value.

**Recommendation:**  
Decode the result and ensure it returns `true`. Otherwise use `IERC20.transfer()` directly with OpenZeppelin’s interface.

---

### 5. 🧱 Owners Stored in Array Only

**Description:**  
The `isOwner()` function loops over an array to check ownership. Costly and inefficient.

**Recommendation:**  
Use `mapping(address => bool) isOwner` for constant-time access.

---

## 🔧 Suggested Improvements

- ✅ Add `ReentrancyGuard` or status-lock pattern.
- ✅ Emit `TransactionRejected` if confirmation fails or time expires.
- ✅ Add `proposeOwnerChange()` system for DAO-like governance.
- ✅ Add support for EIP-712 or off-chain signatures.

## 🧾 Final Remarks

This contract implements the core logic of a multi-signature wallet with a clean structure. It’s a strong foundation for DAO tools, shared treasury wallets, or trustless community management. The vulnerabilities found are moderate but fixable. No critical flaws were identified at this stage.
